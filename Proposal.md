# Proposal

## This is what I'm doing.
During the Winter quarter of the 2017–2018 school year, I intend to create an eBook application. Although I would eventually like to create an iPad application, I do not own a Mac OS device. This will be my first software project, and, by the end of the Winter, I hope to have a working protoype.

## This is why it's important/interesting.
This is an interesting project for me because I want someone else to make this application. While I am not sure if I will get to this point during the ten week time limit, I would eventually like to create my *ideal* eBook reader for my iPad. This eBook reader is inspired after the *neubible* iOS application. This application is, in my opinion, the most beautifully designed eBook reader available. Unlike other eBook reader apps, such as *Kindle* and *iBooks*, this application places typography front and center. However, this application is limited to reading the Bible. The eBook application I would like to create would be akin to a *neubible* for any imported ePub book.

Additionally, the last feature I would like to implement would be an organized highlight navigation. Both Kindle and iBooks have a highlight function that allows users to highlight passages, but the highlight is limited to successive text, and the only way to label a highlight is to use a predefined, small selection of colors. My highlight function would allow highlights with interrupted order, and multiple text labels. Then, when a user goes to the highlight tab of a particular book, they could search and list certain labels. In short, my ideal eBook reader combines design and functionality, and it is surprising I have not found it already created.

## This is how it relates to my other work.
However, as my background in CS is limited to the basics and this is my first independent software project, this ideal is quite ambitious for a ten week time period. Therefore, I hope to be able to have a basic eBook reader prototype created by the end of Winter. I will be using Python as I already have a background with that language. While my CS skills might not be advanced, I have always enjoyed graphic design and art. To infuse my CS projects with this background would be rewarding and exciting.

Finally, while I do not have any experience as a developer, I do have experience as an eBook reader consumer. I have used *Kindle*, *iBooks*, and a host of android reader apps, and during this time I have come to learn exactly what features I want and what are superfluous. For example, the latest Kindle for iPad update, released on November 6th, 2017, introduced an in-built flashcard mode for highlighted text, but erased split-screen support—which, to me, is a fatal mistake. I know what I want in an application, and learning to write an eBook reader application would allow me to create the reader that meets all of my needs.

This class will allow me to start my first software project. I will learn how to get started on a project, breaking a large project into smaller chunks, and how to use the fundamental skills I have learned in a real life situation. Additionally, by sharing my experiences with the class, I will receive valuable feedback. If I get to the point of really customising my prototype, then I will learn about implementing my own artistic design choices in my computer software projects.

## This is my anticipated schedule and outcomes. 
In order to complete this project, my sample schedule will include a rough three phases: researching and understanding an open-source general eBook reader application, creating my own prototype by based on this already created reader, and then customising and advancing this prototype. Since this is my first project, I will estimate high and give the first two stages taking the entire ten weeks in Winter. For a fast track, I would hope to have the first two phases well understood and completed by week eight of Winter quarter, and then start doing design in week nine and ten. I have already found an open-source eBook reader on github written in Python, so depending on how busy Winter break is, I might be able to get phase one completed before Winter quarter starts. Nevertheless, that goal is ambitious, so that time estimate is slim as of right now.

The “deliverables” for phases one and two are my functioning software. For example, in order to have an eBook reader, I will need to be able to import non- DRM ePub files. Therefore, by already having seen an eBook reader’s code that has this function, I will have some direction on how to do this with my own software during stage two. Even if I do not have working code, however, I will still be keeping a weekly journal, and this will signify the lessons and challenges that I encountered even if I do not have physical “deliverables.”
