| 4    | Searched around for a good GUI for Python. Looked at tinker, but I am thinking of using a webkit. So I spent the week seraching for different webkits that will work well on ada. Having a difficult time finding one... Also did a major update to my project site adding my complete proposal and bibliography. |
| 5    | Did not do as much on my ILC as I would have liked due to studying for midterms and catching up on work. However I have decided to abandon tinker. I have been getting familiar with PyGObject, GTK+, and PyWebkitGTK. |
