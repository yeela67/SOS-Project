| Week          | Entry      | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 1    |Created this website. Looked at other people's project websites. Looked over/reread some of my proposal resources and websites.|
| 2    |Searched github for open source projects pertinent epub and ebook readers. Downloaded and read through the code of some of these projects. Read about epub and creating ebook readers on stack overflow.|
| 3    |Downloaded Beautiful Soup for Python to parse xml files in epub files. Started using *Beautiful Soup* to parse pertinent xml files in the epub format such as the opf file.|
| 4    | Searched around for a good GUI for Python. Looked at tinker, but I am thinking of using a webkit. So I spent the week seraching for different webkits that will work well on ada. Having a difficult time finding one... Also did a major update to my project site adding my complete proposal and bibliography. |
| 5    | Did not do as much on my ILC as I would have liked due to studying for midterms and catching up on work. However I have decided to abandon tinker. I have been getting familiar with PyGObject, GTK+, and PyWebkitGTK. | 
| 6    | Learned about Python virtual enviroments. Tried to install the python3-gi for PyGObject and the above needed modules on ADA and found I did not have permission. Tried again using the MAC library computers, but I didn't have permission again. Tried on pythonanywhere.com, and that is one module a user cannot install…|
| 7    | Downloaded Kali Linux on virtual box to try one last time to get the python3-gi module. However, problems arose because the updated version of Linux I intalled only supported WebKit2 instead of WebKit. This was a problem because the webview module (*pywebview 0.5*) I was going to use required WebKit. I thought the learning curve for WebKit2 was a little too high for 3 weeks left, so I tried something else. I decided to switch and buy the only Python IDE available in the iOS store: *Pythonista 3*. I transfered my files over and started trying out the built-in ui module. |
| 8    | Even though the built-in *Pythonista* ui WebView worked on a few simple test html docs I tested, opening the long html files in the epub file would not load. I do not know why… So I had to change course, again. After some thought, I decided to use the "Open URL" to open the html files in mobile Safari. That finally worked, and I got started on creating JavaScript script to override the default CSS. |
| 9    | Created three JavaScript scripts to for three different "themes". They are a "Regular", "Solarized Light", and a "Solarzied Dark". The Solarized Light and Dark are inspired by "Solarized" by Ethan Schoonover. However, my application is still really clunky, and the code got messier as the applicaton grew. I started to try and implement a side table of contents bar and a main menu, but did not get too far. Started preparing for the final week. |
| 10   | Wrote and submited my final status report with slides, and updated my journal. |
